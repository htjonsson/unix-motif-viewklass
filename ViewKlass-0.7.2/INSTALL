The configure script which is included in this release is, pretty much,
the one which was written for the Hungry project. It works for me but
I don't have any experience with autoconf or configure.
Until I learn more (or someone offers to help out on the project :-)) it will
have to do.
The test subdirectory uses a plain, simple Makefile.

I have built the libraries on the following -
Red Hat 6.2 / kernel 2.2.14-12 intel / egcs-2.91.66
Red Hat 7.0 / kernel 2.2.16-22 intel / gcc 2.96
Sun Solaris 2.5 sparc / gcc 2.95
Sun Solaris 8 sparc / gcc 2.95


The basic steps are:
./configure    - creates the Makefile
make           - just build the libraries
make install   - build the libraries and install them
make test      - build and install the libraries, and build the test harness
