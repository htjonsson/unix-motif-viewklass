ViewKlass test harness

This directory contains 3 test programs;

vktest, which contains test code for most of the ViewKlass classes,
staticMenuTest, which is intended primarily for testing the static
definition of Menus and resourceTest which provides a test harness
for VkGetResource function.

There are also 3 resource files, Vktest, StaticMenuTest and
ResourceTest, which demonstrate many of the ways in which ViewKlass
uses resources.
These files should be copied to $HOME so that they are read during
application startup. Alternatively you can set XAPPLRESDIR to point
to this test directory.

The Slider class is an example of a component derived from VkComponent.


Have Fun,
